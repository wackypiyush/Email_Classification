# Email Classification
Welcome to the "Email Classification" project, where I've developed a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not. This project showcases the power of machine learning in automating the task of email filtering.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to provide a reliable tool for classifying emails, ensuring that legitimate emails are separated from spam, thus enhancing user experience and email management. The model is trained using the XGBoost algorithm, achieving an impressive accuracy of 98.8% on the training set and 98% on the test set.

## How to Use the Email Classification Tool
 Using the Email Classification Tool is straightforward:

1. Access the tool via the following link: https://emailclassification.streamlit.app/#spam-classification-app

2. Enter the email you want to classify into the provided input field.

3. Click the 'Classify' button.

4. The result will be displayed, indicating whether the email is classified as 'Spam' or 'Not.'

## Key Highlights
High Accuracy: The model has undergone rigorous training, achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 98.8% on the training set and maintaining a strong 98% accuracy on the test set. This high accuracy ensures reliable email classification.

User-Friendly: The tool is designed for ease of use. It simplifies the process of email classification, making it accessible to users with minimal technical knowledge.
